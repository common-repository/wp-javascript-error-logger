A plugin that will log JavaScript-errors that occurs on the front-end of your website. Errors are logged to a non-public custom post type.

== Description ==

WP JS Error Logger is a small plugin that I very quickly put together after wathcing [Diogo Antunes'](https://twitter.com/dicode) presentation ["Know your errors"](https://speakerdeck.com/dicode/know-your-errors) at [Front Trends 2013](http://2013.front-trends.com/) in Warsaw, Poland.

It's a plugin that will log the JavaScript-errors that occur on the front-end of your public website. Errors are logged to a non-public custom post type inside WordPress.

The errors that are logged are the errors that call window.onerror. Please note that not all errors end up there. But... some do, and now you can catch them! ;)

== Screenshots ==

1. The overview screen inside WordPress. Each error is it's own post.

2. Details about an error: URL, line, type.
